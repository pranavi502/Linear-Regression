# Linear-Regression
**Linear Regression Project (SLR & MLR):**

This project demonstrates how I implemented Simple Linear Regression (SLR) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) using Python.
The goal was to understand the basics of regression, work with real datasets, and evaluate model performance.

**What is Linear Regression?**

SLR: Predicts output using one input variable.

MLR: Predicts output using multiple input variables.

**What I Did**

Prepared and analyzed datasets

Built SLR and MLR models

Trained and tested the models

Visualized results using graphs

Evaluated performance with metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R²

**Tools Used**

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

**How to Run**

Install the required libraries

Open the notebook or script

Run the code step by step to see results
